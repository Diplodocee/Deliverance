          <p>Chris Munley is a senior (Class of 2016) from Charlotte, North Carolina.  When he's not jamming out on the bass line in an a capella arrangement,

          Chris has a twin brother (not identical) who also attends Wash U.
          Chris is Deliverance's ACAC representative, which means that he is responsible for meeting with members of other a capella groups to plan what's next for the music community at Wash U.</p>

          <p>Katie Engsberg is a senior (Class of 2016) from Eureka, Missouri.  Katie is studying for a major in the Interdisciplinary Project in the Humanities.
          She has a great passion for creative writing, and when not pursuing world peace through inter-religious dialogue 
          (which, let’s face it, takes up lots of her time), she enjoys immersing herself in her imagination through reading, writing, and watching British television.
          F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sherlock, J.R.R. Tolkein, C.S. Lewis, Doctor Who, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are some of her favorite distractions.
          She can also draw sporadically and loves baking.</p>
          <p>In Deliverance, Katie is an alto and the General Coordinator, which means that she looks after the practical functioning of the group: planning rehearsals and events, sending out e-mails, and reserving spaces and equipment.</p>

          In Deliverance, Lincoln sings bass and serves as one of the group's music directors, running Saturday rehearsals and helping Laura and Katie make decisions about the future of the group.
