          <p><h2 style="color:white">About Deliverance</h2></p>
          <br>
          <p>Deliverance was started in the fall of 2004 by Christine Wang (WU â€™05) in pursuit of her dream of using a capella music to reach the Washington University campus with the Gospel.
          Over the years, the group's mission has grown from simply being the voice of Christianity within the a capella community toward the goal of being a unifying force and a voice of outreach for the Christians at Wash U.</p>
          <p>We believe there is a power in music to unify and to express, and we believe that God can work through us and our songs to bring glory to His name and to bring hope and love to those around us.
          We find in our music a way to praise our God and express His goodness by creating beauty and enjoyment in His name.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-10 col-md-10">
          <p><h4 style="color:white">How do we choose our music?</h4></p>
          <p>Deliverance strives to represent a wide range of Christian music, from hymns to rock to country to gospel.
          At the end of each semester, each member of the group is allowed to suggest 3-5 songs for the next semester.
          We post the songs in our Facebook group and discuss them for one to two weeks, and then we vote on our favorites.
          In case of a tie, the music directors choose the songs that they believe to best represent the mission of the group.</p>
          <br>
          <p><h4 style="color:white">How do we get our arrangements?</h4></p>
          <p>Most of the music that we sing is arranged by members of Deliverance.  After we choose our songs for the semester, 
          those who wish to arrange can choose a song to put to music.  We generally use the free music notation editor Musescore 
          in order to ensure that everyone has a common platform on which to listen to and interact with the sheet music.
          For examples of past arrangements, see our Song Directory on the Music page.</p>
          <br>
          <p><h4 style="color:white">How much of a time commitment is Deliverance?</h4></p>
          <p>We have two 2-hour rehearsals per week at times set based on the schedules of the members. Additionally, 
          men and women have separate one-hour sectionals at some point during the week.  This adds up to 5 hours during a normal week
          (about the same as your average science class), although concerts and other performances add to that time (albeit in a fun way) 
          every once in a while.</p>
          <br>
          <p><h4 style="color:white">How can you join us?</h4></p>
          <p>We're always looking for new voices to join us in proclaiming the glory of our King.  If you would like to join the group,
          you can audition at the beginning of each semester or during one of our twice-weekly rehearsals.  Anyone can audition,
          and no choral background is necessary. For more details, see the Audition page.</p>
